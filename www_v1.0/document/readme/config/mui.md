# Installation
Install Material UI, the world's most popular React UI framework.

## Default installation

Run one of the following commands to add Material UI to your project:
```
yarn add @mui/material @emotion/react @emotion/styled
```
## With styled-components
```
yarn add @mui/material @mui/styled-engine-sc styled-components
```


## Icons

To use the font Icon component or the prebuilt SVG Material Icons (such as those found in the icon demos), you must first install the Material Icons font. You can do so with npm, or with the Google Web Fonts CDN.

```
yarn add @mui/icons-material
```
